LCARS-For-Wordpress
===================

LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) for Wordpress.

Greetings, I'm Brian Scott Gregory, lover of Science Fiction and Fantasy, coder, hacker, and generally
out for a good time - and clearly a proponent of the Star Trek Universe.

This is a touch based browser operating system with easy object oriented reuseable controls leveraging clean javascript with skinnable interfaces that look and feel and act like the computer systems in Star Trek. 

CBS has infamously made programmer's lives difficult when it comes to creating revenue based on
Intellectual Property of the Star Trek franchise - and the LCARS system as a whole. 

This is a giant crock of doo. 

Microsoft tried suing Apple for look and feel infringement of their user interface, where they summarily 
lost the case. This established legal precendent, and protects ANY AND ALL WORKS we do as individuals based on 
the LCARS look and feel we saw in Star Trek.

(Case information here: 
Thanks to Microsoft vs Apple Computer, here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.

Full case name 	Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Co.
Citation(s) 	35 F.3d 1435; 63 USLW 2259, 1994 Copr.L.Dec. P 27,301, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1086 )

To protect against litigation cease and desists, this is remaining open source but I will gladly contract out to help you - persoanlly or your corporation - make this a part of your enterprise. 

And if you happen to OWN an actual Starship Enterprise. Nope. I wouldn't be surprised if you came to me.  And yes, I will help fix your broken systems and reprogram your holodeck, I am well aware of the issues you're having and why. No, they aren't going to be able to fix them, you know who we're talking about, as they stole the work to begin with. 

This project is a work in progress. Clearly.
