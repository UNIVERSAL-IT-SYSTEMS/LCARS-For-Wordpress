LCARS-For-Wordpress
===================

LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) for Wordpress

Greetings, I'm Brian Scott Gregory, lover of Science Fiction and Fantasy, coder, hacker, and generally
out for a good time - and clearly a proponent of the Star Trek Universe.

CBS has infamously made programmer's lives difficult when it comes to creating revenue based on
Intellectual Property of the Star Trek franchise - and the LCARS system as a whole. They would like to think
they own absolutely everything contained within the series. If they had their way, they'd be representing
the Borg and claim the human image is theirs too, and we shouldn't be allowed to have it and it's their property.

So here's the legal scoop if you want to do work on your own LCARS or Star Trek themed variations 
and legally snub the 'cease and desist' by shitcanning those threats:

1) Copyrights - are not valid for Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, 
discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration. Works consisting 
entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship.

CBS knows this. And a simple search of the United States Copyright database here:
http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=lcars&Search_Code=FT*&PID=B7HIbE87_-5Ql-ju6JpAi5QzVoNK&SEQ=20140303151913&CNT=100&HIST=1

OR the patent database here:
http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=LCARS&FIELD1=&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PG01

.. elicits no restrictions or claims on the computer interface. 

Now if you do a search on 'Star Trek' you see thousands of claims. But not one for the LCARS computer system.

So legally, since they have not patented the LCARS interface and filed for a copyright, and it's clearly an
uncommitted concept and idea, then according to basic copyright law, they have no legal grounds to stand on. 

So let's say they decide to react by patenting the ideas and concepts - which they have yet to do. This
is absolutely a valid tactic. They've established linear precedence with the creation of the Star Trek series, 
and the LCARS interface has been out since Star Trek first appeared in 1966, right?

What is a Patent? (From Black's Law Book - the Lawyer's Bible) A patent is a legal document which provides
protection to the ideas of any individual. Usually issued by the Patent Office of a country, the patent is granted 
to any firm or individual. Usually, patents constitute of four different classes: Machine (a device or apparatus
created by a person for the performance of a specific task, process (a process created by an individual), 
manufacture (any fabricated or manufactured product) or the composition of matter (any chemical mixture or
compound created by a person). Patents can be sued for.

So any work we do they can claim for their own if they obtain a patent, right?

Not so fast, podner, there's something called legal precedence - and thanks to Microsoft vs Apple Computer, here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.

Full case name 	Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Co.
Citation(s) 	35 F.3d 1435; 63 USLW 2259, 1994 Copr.L.Dec. P 27,301, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1086

Where Microsoft tried suing Apple for look and feel infringement of their user interface, where they summarily 
lost the case. This established legal precendent, and protects ANY AND ALL WORKS we do as individuals based on 
the LCARS look and feel we saw in Star Trek.

Now as a final aside. There's a little blurb in patent law which states "A patent is essentially a limited 
monopoly whereby the patent holder is granted the exclusive right to make, use, and sell the patented innovation 
for a limited period of time."

Note the keywords. LIMITED monopoly to SELL a product for a limited period of time.

a) LCARS has NEVER (publicly) been sold as a product. I repeat. Never. Publicly.
b) Even if it had been, Microsoft vs Apple set legal precedence and made the LCARS Interface public domain.

There's a rumor that the ezisting 'product' that doesn't exist is slow to load, and unresponsive. 

I'm a decent coder, not so great at organization, and asking you, the open source community, to work with me and 
the company I represent - Vrilliant - to help develop something that can be leveraged, for free, for anyone, anywhere 
to use, to learn from, to play with, and to make this product something amazing to use not just for wordpress, but 
for any user interface imaginable. 

And for those companies who cannot leverage open source for enterprise deployment and need a legitimate commercial 
enterprise - which there are quite a few still out there - 99% of the funds I acquire from this venture will go 
into creating an actual starship named the "USS Phoenix", to honor the ship of the same name sold to Argentina 
just after surviving Pearl Harbor in World War 2, and to honor the city by the same name in Arizona, United States 
- which I've spent most my formative life in.

I intend on working with Richard Branson, directly, to make Spaceport America a very real Commercial Enterprise for 
Space Travel. Without calling the ship an Enterprise. That I'll reserve for the original our of respect.

On that note, LCARS is nothing more than a graphical user interface, protected by Microsoft vs Apple, written in
Javascript to demonstrate a USER INTERFACE TO an operating system for the web which can be 'reskinned' to have ANY
look and feel the customer wants.  Whether it's your love of soccer (futball), science fiction movies, monkeys, or 
whatever you can imagine - the intention here is to create standard methods and re-useable objects to base your
interactions off of, and this is the framework to do rapid creation of graphical design with stableuser interface
design elements.

It's a work in progress. Clearly.
